# Cooking-with-Machine-Learning

step one :
upload the data from Json Format , change the name of cuisine  from String to id number 
uising count vectorizer  for X value  and lebalecouder for Y value 
X will see like that -   ((Class , ingredients) number of ingredients ) 

step two : 
to go deep in learning you need to select the most pupoler class (cuisine)
like  (italy 8000 exempale)

step three : 
if you want you can run Logistic Regresion to find the most importent features by doing max on theta 
wall the fit functio will return thr list of theta and you can find the max value this max will give you 
the best features 
in my file you can see that i  run check in (all , 300 , 100) features and 300 fetures is the bast option .

step four :
run Logistic Regresion or AdaBoost if you like  
to learn and after predict the y value and compare the to y test.
